# Instructions to Build the Source

## Dependencies
In order to build SPEEDD ML module from source you need to have Java SE (e.g., OpenJDK) version 8 or higher and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) (v0.13.x) installed in your system.

All library dependencies are defined inside the `build.sbt`. In addition, the module requires the following projects to be locally build and published:

**1.** Clone and publish locally the auxlib project:
```bash
$ git clone -b v0.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/anskarl/auxlib.git
$ cd auxlib
$ sbt ++2.11.8 publishLocal
```

**2.** Clone and publish locally the LoMRF project (additional instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF)).

```bash
$ git clone -b v0.5.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF.git
$ cd LoMRF
$ sbt publishLocal
```

## LPSolve Installation Instructions
Weight learning of SPEEDD ML requires LPSolve to be installed in your OS.

#### Install LPSolve v5.5.x to ***Debian-based*** distribution:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install lp-solve
```

Installation of Java Native Interface support for LPSolve v5.5.x:
* Download [LPSolve dev](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/): *lp_solve_5.5.2.x_dev_ux64.zip* for 64bit or *lp_solve_5.5.2.x_dev_ux32.zip* for 32bit.
  * Extract the archive and keep `lpsolve55.so` file.
* Download LPSolve java bindings [lp_solve_5.5.2.x_java.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/).
    * Extract the archive and keep `lpsolve55j.so` file.
* Create a directory containing the `lpsolve55.so` and `lpsolve55j.so` files, e.g., `$HOME/lib/lpsolve55`
* Add the directory to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in your profile:

**BASH** e.g., inside `.profile`, `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib/lpsolve55
```

**CSH/TCSH** e.g., inside `~/.login` file in your home directory:
```csh
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ($LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HOME/lib/lpsolve55 .)
```
or in `~/.cshrc` file in your home directory:
```csh
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib/lpsolve55:.
```

#### Install LPSolve 5.5.x to ***Apple Mac OSX***
Either download and install from the [LPSolve website](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net) or use your favorite package manager:

[Macports](https://www.macports.org):
```bash
$ sudo port install lp_solve
```

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh):
```bash
$ brew tap homebrew/science

  * Add the directory to the PATH environment variable in your system environment variables (see [instructions](#microsoft-windows-operating-systems)).

## Build SPEEDD ML Module
To build the SPEEDD ML Module type the following commands:
```bash
$ cd path/to/speedd/speedd-ml
$ sbt clean dist
```

After a successful compilation, the SPEEDD ML module is located inside the `./target/universal/speedd-ml-<version>.zip` file. You can extract this file and add `path/to/speedd-ml-<version>/bin` in your PATH in order to execute the SPEEDD ML module scripts from terminal.
